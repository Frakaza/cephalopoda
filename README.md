# Cephalopoda

A collection of low profile split ergonomic mechanical keyboards I have created using [ergogen](https://github.com/mrzealot/ergogen).

## Sepia officinalis
AKA S. officinalis, S.O., "The first one", "Cuttlefish"

34 keys, aggresive pinky stagger with top row omitted.

## Metasepia pfefferi
AKA M. pfefferi, M.P., "The second one", "Flamboyant cuttlefish"

26 keys, similar to the S. officinalis, but with top/bottom keys of pinky and inner columns omitted. 2 thumb keys.

## Dosidicus gigas
AKA D. gigas, D.G., "The third one", "Jumbo squid"

32 keys, same pinky stagger as S. officinalis and M. pfefferi, but with all "alpha" keys included. Pinky, ring, index, and inner columns splayed at 15, 5, -5, -5 degrees from middle column.

## Todarodes pacificus
AKA T. pacificus, T.P., "The fourth one", "Japanese flying squid"

30 keys, 15, 5, 0, -5, -5 degree splay. My take on the Hummingbird layout.

## Todarodes sagittatus
AKA T. sagittatus, T.S., "The fifth one", "European flying squid"

Same stagger as the T. pacificus, but no splay.

## Idiosepius thailandicus
AKA I. thailandicus, I.T., "The sixth one", "Pygmy bobtail squid"

Designed with the ARTSEY layout in mind, but could also be used with ASTENIOP.
BlueMicro compatible.
